My Android Password Secured Store, MAPSS does not collect any user data.
MAPSS does not share any user data.
MAPSS may require bluetooth permissions to synchronize data with the users personal Windows PC or laptop.
However this synchronization is only done with the users consent and synching is over an encrypted channel.
